/* Custom Tailwind Configuration Extension (for JIT mode) */
/* If you're using a full Tailwind setup with PostCSS, this would go in tailwind.config.js */
/* For CDN, we need to include it like this or define in a <script> tag in HTML before custom CSS */
/* For simplicity in this direct file separation, we'll keep the Tailwind config in HTML head.
   However, if you wanted to manage it here, you'd need a build step.
   For this exercise, the config in the original HTML's <script> block is okay as a quick fix for CDN.
   For production, use a proper tailwind.config.js and build process. */
